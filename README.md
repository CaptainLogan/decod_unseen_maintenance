Paris_orientation-decoding
==========================

Paris project 2012-2013. This repository stores all scripts to analyse MEG data from the orientation decoding project.

Paradigm: 20 subjects were presented with a Gabor patch that could vary among 6 different orientations and flashed very briefly on screen before being masked by a heavy-contrasted circular mask. After the mask a strong contrast probe Gabor patch was flashed around 800 ms after the initial target. The probe's orientation could be tilted 30Â° to the right or to the left of the initial target. Subjects evaluated the tilt of the probe compared to the target (clockwise vs counter clockwise) with left button press and after reported the visibility of the target stimulus on a 4-points scale ranging from 1. not seen to 4. perfectly seen.
